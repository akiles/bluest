# Change Log

## 0.6.6

- Fix compilation on iOS

## 0.6.5

- Fix another segmentation violation on MacOS/iOS introduced in v0.6.1

## 0.6.4

- Fix a segmentation violation on MacOS/iOS introduced in v0.6.1

## 0.6.3

- Add `ServicesChanged::was_invalidated` method to check if a particular service
  was invalidated by a service changed indication

## 0.6.2

- Add `Device::service_changed_indications` to get a stream of service changed
  indications from the device

## 0.6.1

- Fix a bug on MacOS/iOS where the event channels could be closed prematurely

## 0.6.0

- `Characteristic::write_without_response` now returns a `Result<()>`
- Added `Send + Unpin` constraints to returned `impl Stream` values
- Reduced the number and weight of dependencies
- Removed static `bluer` session on Linux. Each `Adapter` now starts its own
  session.

## 0.5.7

- Fix Windows compilation error

## 0.5.6

- Added `Characteristic::max_write_len()` to get the maximum data that can be
  written to the characteristic in a single packet (this is 3 bytes less than
  the negotiated MTU for the connection; this is a method on the
  `Characteristic` instead of the `Device` because Linux only exposes this value
  on characteristics).
- Added limited support for `device_connection_events` on MacOS
- Tightened the behavior of the non-discover counterparts of discovery methods
  (i.e. `Device::services()`, `Service::characteristics()`,
  `Service::included_characteristics()`, `Characteristic::descriptors()`) to
  always perform discovery if discovery has not previously been performed.
- Fix docs.rs example scraping

## 0.5.5

## 0.5.0

- `Device::name` now returns a `Result`
- `Characteristic::properties` is now async
- Added `_async` APIs to all platforms for methods which are sync on some
  platforms and async on others

- Add `Adapter::connected_devices`
- Add `Adapter::connected_devices_with_services`
- Add re-export of the `Uuid` struct
